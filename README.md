Project: To-Do App Using JavaScript

You will see 2 sections of the app before you. On the left side the Task Hub and on the right the Task List. The task hub is where all your todo lists are stored. The Task List is where your tasks are stored.

In order to start creating new tasks you must first create a hub by typing something into the box with the blue create button then by clicking the blue create button (or by pressing enter). After this is done you may now create tasks. You may also notice the blue outline around your created hub. This is to indiciate to you that this hub has been selected and that the tasks you create will be added to that specific hub. 

Once you move onto making tasks (which there is no create task button for you will just have to press enter). You will notice once you've created a task 4 sections of the task. A circle which you can click to mark a task as completed. A description/name of the task you wrote. An edit button that when clicked allows you to change the contents of the task and a delete button that allows you to delete a singular task.

Below that are 2 buttons, one will only show up if you have marked a task as completed and will allow you to clear all completed tasks. The other is a delete all button that will delete all tasks within a given hub.
